    dts exercises notebooks

Go inside and read and work through the following notebooks (in sequence):

- `braitenberg01`
- `braitenberg02`
- `braitenberg03`

In those notebooks you need to fill out some functions that will create your agent.

You can test your agent using these modalities:

1. ðŸ’» `dts exercises test --sim` -- tries the agent in simulation.
2. ðŸš™ `dts exercises test --duckiebot_name DUCKIEBOT` -- tries the agent on your robot.
3. ðŸš™ `dts exercises test --local --duckiebot_name DUCKIEBOT` -- tries the agent on your robot but running on the laptop.

For additional information on how to navigate the `dt-exercises` infrastructure you can watch [this tutorial](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_duckiebot/out/running_exercies.html).

You can the evaluate your work using

The robot should travel at least an average of 2 meters without hitting any duckie.
